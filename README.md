# Searchbox

Start your search from a more comfortable place, say the upper right corner?

Here's demo of search and replace component, and also *match_all* search.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have [Neovim v0.5.1](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.5.1) or greater.

### Dependencies

- [nui.nvim](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim)

### Installation

Use your favorite plugin manager. For example.

With `vim-plug`

```vim
Plug 'MunifTanjim/nui.nvim'
Plug 'VonHeikemen/searchbox.nvim'
```

With `packer`.

```lua
use {
  'VonHeikemen/searchbox.nvim',
  requires = {
    {'MunifTanjim/nui.nvim'}
  }
}
```

### Types of search

There are four kinds of search:

* `incsearch`: Highlights the nearest match of your query as you type.

* `match_all`: Highlights all the matches in the buffer as you type. By default matches will stay highlighted after you submit your search. You can clear them with `:SearchBoxClear`. If you want the highlight to disapear after the input closes, add the `clear_matches` argument (more on this later).

* `simple`: Doesn't do anything as you type. No highlight, no moving the cursor around in realtime. It's only purpose is to execute a search.

* `replace`: Starts a multi-step input to search and replace. First input allows you to enter a pattern (search term). Second input will ask for the string that will replace the previous pattern.

## Usage

Each type of search is a lua function you can bind to a key. Example.

* **Lua Bindings**

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(
  'n',
  '<leader>s',
  '<cmd>lua require("searchbox").incsearch()<CR>',
  {noremap = true}
)
```

* **Vimscript Bindings**

```vim
nnoremap <leader>s <cmd>lua require('searchbox').incsearch()<CR>
```

### Visual mode

In visual mode you'll need to add `<Esc>` at the beginning of the mapping and use `visual_mode = true` in the arguments.

In this mode the search is limited to the range set by the selected text. Similar to what the `substitute` command does in this case `:'<,'>s/this/that/g`.

* lua

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(
  'x',
  '<leader>s',
  '<Esc><cmd>lua require("searchbox").incsearch({visual_mode = true})<CR>',
  {noremap = true}
)
```

* vimscript

```vim
xnoremap <leader>s <Esc><cmd>lua require("searchbox").incsearch({visual_mode = true})<CR>
```

### Search function arguments

You can tweak the behaviour of the search if you pass a table with any of these keys:

* `reverse`: Look for matches above the cursor.
* `exact`: Look for an exact match.
* `title`: Set title for the popup window.
* `prompt`: Set input prompt.
* `default_value`: Set initial value for the input.
* `visual_mode`: Search only in the recently selected text.

*match_all* search also accepts:

* `clear_matches`: Get rid of the highlight after the search is done.

*replace* search accepts:

* `confirm`: Ask the user to choose an action on each match. There are three possible values: `off`, `native` and `menu`. `off` disables the feature. `native` uses neovim's built-in confirm method. `menu` displays a list of possible actions below the match. Is worth mentioning `menu` will only show up if neovim's window is big enough, confirm type will fallback to "native" if it isn't.

Here are some examples:

Make a reverse search, like the default `?`:

```vim
<cmd>lua require("searchbox").incsearch({reverse = true})<CR>
```

Make the highlight of `match_all` go away after submit.

```vim
<cmd>lua require("searchbox").match_all({clear_matches = true})<CR>
```

Move to the nearest exact match without any fuss.

```vim
<cmd>lua require("searchbox").simple({exact = true})<CR>
```

Start a search and replace.

```vim
<cmd>lua require("searchbox").replace()<CR>
```

Use the word under the cursor to begin search and replace. (Normal mode).

```vim
<cmd>lua require('searchbox').replace({default_value = vim.fn.expand('<cword>')})<CR>
```

Use the selected text as a search term (needs visual mode):

```vim
y<cmd>lua require('searchbox').replace({default_value = vim.fn.getreg('"')})<CR>
```
> Due to limitations on the input, It can't handle newlines well or even the escape sequence \n. So whatever you have selected, must be one line.

Search and replace within the range of the selected text, and look for an exact match. (Needs to be mapped in visual mode)

```vim
<Esc><cmd>lua require("searchbox").replace({exact = true, visual_mode = true})<CR>
```

Confirm every match of search and replace

- Normal mode:

```vim
<cmd>lua require("searchbox").replace({confirm = 'menu'})<CR>
```

- Visual mode:

```vim
<Esc><cmd>lua require("searchbox").replace({confirm = 'menu', visual_mode = true})<CR>
```

### Default keymaps

Inside the input you can use the following keymaps:

* `Enter`: Submit input.
* `Esc`: Closes input.
* `Ctrl + c`: Close input.
* `Ctrl + y`: Scroll up.
* `Ctrl + e`: Scroll down.
* `Ctrl + b`: Scroll page up.
* `Ctrl + f`: Scroll page down.

In the confirm menu (of search and replace):

* `y`: Confirm replace.
* `n`: Move to next match.
* `a`: Replace all matches.
* `q`: Quit menu.
* `l`: Replace match then quit. Think of it as "the last replace".
* `Enter`: Accept option.
* `Esc`: Quit menu.
* `ctrl + c`: Quit menu.
* `Tab`: Next option.
* `shift + Tab`: Previous option.
* `Down arrow`: Next option.
* `Up arrow`: Previous option.

The "native" confirm method:

* `y`: Confirm replace.
* `n`: Move to next match.
* `a`: Replace all matches.
* `q`: Quit menu.
* `l`: Replace match then quit.

## Configuration

If you want to change anything in the `UI` or add a "hook" you can use `.setup()`.

This are the defaults.

```lua
require('searchbox').setup({
  popup = {
    relative = 'win',
    position = {
      row = '5%',
      col = '95%',
    },
    size = 30,
    border = {
      style = 'rounded',
      highlight = 'FloatBorder',
      text = {
        top = ' Search ',
        top_align = 'left',
      },
    },
    win_options = {
      winhighlight = 'Normal:Normal',
    },
  },
  hooks = {
    before_mount = function(input)
      -- code
    end,
    after_mount = function(input)
      -- code
    end
  }
})
```

- `popup` is passed directly to `nui.popup`. You can check the valid keys in their documentation: [popup.options](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim/tree/main/lua/nui/popup#options)

- `hooks` must be functions. They will be executed during the "lifecycle" of the input.

`before_mount` and `after_mount` receive the instance of the input, so you can do anything with it.

## Caveats

It's very possible that I can't simulate every feature of the built-in search (`/` and  `?`).

## Contributing

Bug fixes are welcome. Everything else? Let's discuss it first.

If you want to improve the UI it will be better if you contribute to [nui.nvim](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim).
